1) Loop Body:
A loop iterating a specific number of times commonly consists of three parts: a loop
variable initialization before the loop, a terminating condition with the loop
expression, and a loop variable update at the end of the loop body.

2) Terminating Condition:
a terminating condition with the loop
expression, and a loop variable update at the end of the loop body.

3) Increment:
increment is represented by to plusses in a row. (adding 1)

4) Decrement:
The decrement operator is represented by two minus signs in a row. They would subtract 1 
from the value of whatever was in the variable being decremented.

5) While Loop:
A while loop is a loop that repeatedly executes the loop body while the loop's expression
evaluates to true.

6) For Loop:
A for loop is a loop consisting of a loop variable initialization, a
loop expression, and a loop variable update that typically describes iterating for a
specific number of times.

7) Nested Loops:
A nested loop is a loop that appears in the body of another loop.

8) Inner Loop:
The inner loop is a for loop that handles the printing of the asterisks.

9) Outer Loop:
The outer loop is a while loop that handles executing until a negative number is entered.
